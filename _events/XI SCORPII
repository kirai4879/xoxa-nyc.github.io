We come together for a special collaborative event between Midnight Society and XOXA under the Scorpio constellation skies. Join us for a magical evening of beats, live music, performances, tarot, and more.

**XOXA is an all inclusive queer space. Everyone is welcome in our space but please be respectful to those attending. If you see something say something-we will not hesitate to remove anyone who is violating the space.**

***CONSENT CONSENT CONSENT is required in all interactions. Just ask—it’s that simple—before touching, taking photos, etc….***
